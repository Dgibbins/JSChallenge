This first lesson covers how to bind audio files to <kbd> elements.


I've added on a second layer, not only do you have a drumkit but get the soothing voice of our movie classic & martial arts marvel, Bruce, the Fist of Fury, Lee!!!


Approaching this problem:

1. Want to an addEventListener to play these sounds.

2. Need a function for playing the sound.

3. Need a function that will handle transition effects.\
      (hint: this will require making a keys constant, then using this constant and calling on the Object.forEach() method.)



Personal note:

  - Brush up on the .addEventListener('transitionend', function);
  - data- attribute in html.
